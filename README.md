How did you decide the tech stack?

When deciding on the tech stack for my project, I took several factors into consideration. First and foremost, I wanted to develop an iOS app, so XCode was the natural choice as the integrated development environment (IDE) for iOS app development. As for the programming language, I chose Swift due to its modernity, readability, and strong support within the iOS development community. Swift's expressive syntax and safety features appealed to me, making it an ideal language for building robust and user-friendly applications. Additionally, I opted to use SQLite as my database since it provided a lightweight and efficient solution for storing and retrieving pin data within the app.

What was the design process like?

The design process for my iOS app was both challenging and rewarding. I began by sketching out the user interface (UI) on paper, envisioning how the map and pins would be displayed. I then moved on to creating wireframes using Figma, refining the layout and user flow. Once I had a solid foundation, I started implementing the UI, and got familiar with the use of “View’s” in Swift. 
As I progressed in the development process, I also explored the use of custom animations and transitions to enhance the user experience and add a touch of interactivity to the app. Iterative testing and user feedback played a crucial role in refining the design, allowing me to identify and make necessary adjustments. Through this iterative process, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of user-centered design and the value of incorporating user feedback into the development cycle. Overall, the design process was a creative and iterative journey, where I transformed initial sketches and wireframes into a polished and intuitive user interface using XCode's powerful tools and Swift's expressive language feature

What made me want to make something like this?

The inspiration behind developing an app that allows users to drop pins on a map with custom captions stemmed from my passion for exploring new places and sharing those experiences with others. I wanted to create a tool that would enable users to mark significant locations, such as favorite restaurants, scenic spots, or cherished memories, and easily revisit them or share them with friends. The idea of creating a visually appealing and interactive map-based app excited me, as it aligned with my interest in combining technology with personal experiences.

How was learning Swift, the Swift libraries/frameworks?

Learning Swift was an enriching experience that allowed me to delve into the world of modern app development. Swift's syntax and concepts were relatively easy to grasp, especially as I already had a background in programming. The UI features were much more challenging however, as I had no prior app development experience. The language's strong type system and safety features were particularly valuable, as they helped me write more reliable code and catch errors early. Exploring the vast array of Swift libraries and frameworks available in the iOS ecosystem was both daunting and exciting. These libraries provided powerful tools for handling maps, user interaction, data storage, and more. By leveraging libraries such as MapKit and SQLite.swift, I was able to accelerate the development process and enhance the functionality of my app. 

What resources did I use?

Throughout my project, I relied on various resources to enhance my understanding of iOS development and Swift. Online tutorials, documentation, and video courses were invaluable in providing guidance and examples. Websites like iosExample.com and Hacking with Swift provided comprehensive tutorials and practical projects, covering a wide range of topics from basic Swift syntax to advanced iOS app development techniques. I also utilized official Apple documentation, which proved to be an authoritative source for understanding the more intricate parts of Swift and the iOS frameworks. Additionally, I joined online communities such as Stack Overflow and Reddit, where I could seek help, ask questions, and learn from experienced developers who generously shared their knowledge. 

In conclusion, embarking on my project and developing an iOS app using XCode, Swift, and SQLite was a transformative experience. The tech stack proved to be a robust choice, allowing me to create a visually appealing and interactive map-based application. Through the design process, I honed my skills in UI/UX design, leveraging wireframes and iterative development to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface. Learning Swift and exploring its libraries and frameworks opened up a world of possibilities, enabling me to implement advanced features and enhance the functionality of my app. The process of developing the app challenged me to think critically, problem-solve, and iterate on my ideas, leading to significant growth in my programming skills and knowledge. Additionally, the resources I utilized, such as online tutorials, documentation, and community forums, played a vital role in supporting my learning journey and providing guidance whenever I encountered obstacles. Overall, my project allowed me to apply the knowledge and skills I acquired throughout my computer science studies, while also fostering a deep passion for mobile app development and setting a solid foundation for my future career in software engineering.
